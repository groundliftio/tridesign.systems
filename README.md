# Triangle Design Systems Website

This is a simple website for the Triangle Design Systems meetup to share information like the code of conduct.

## Setup

At its core, this is just a static HTML site, so you don't technically need to install anything, but if you want relatively easy local development, you can use `npm install` to install the http-server and `npm start` to serve at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Alternatively, you can just serve the public folder from the file system.
